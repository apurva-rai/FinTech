# Hack KU 2020 Submission - Financial Technology

Our take on FinTech is a website designed to allow small businesses to affordably manage business analytics and make predictions about future analytics based on as many data points as possible. Currently we are focusing on using past business data, data from related businesses, weather, and anomalous events (e.g. superbowl or special sale) to predict future analytics. We also plan on adding features like scheduling and integration with existing small business software like Square if time permits.

## Current State
We are currently in the development stage.
- [ ] Alpha Stage
    - Find a local business that would be willing to share their data with us so we can test the accuracy of our system and get instant feedback on what we could improve/fix.
- [ ] Beta Stage
    - Pitch our services to more local businesses to help further refine our system.
- [ ] Launch
    - Begin marketing on larger scale and allow any business to buy and use our system.

## Environment
In the future our webapp will be hosted on a [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) droplet running Ubuntu 18.04.3 with Apache Tomcat 8 or 9 and a Nginx proxy server.
